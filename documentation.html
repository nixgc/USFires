            <p>This project was created using the following programs: HTML, CSS, 
            JavaScript, MySQL, and excel. 
            The idea behind this product is to have a map of the United States of 
            America and display data based off of fires in the nation. We chose to display
            four different attributes that are shown by having different colors. Those 
            attributes are white flames for Death Toll, orange flames for Number of 
            Fires, red flames for Damage, and green flames for Cost. Each state will
            have all four flames representing their own personal data. The piece of data 
            that is more prevalent has an opaquer transparency compared to less 
            prevalent data which is more translucent. If you want to zoom in on an individual state and look at its data, all you have to do is click on that state which will light up when 
            you hover over it.</p> 
            <p>The data that we gathered was found throughout several websites, we 
            took that data from 2010-2019 and displayed it in an artistic way. There are 
            check boxes for each one of those years that pulls data to display the flames.
            The way the flames transparency changes all depends on the data that has 
            been averaged out to get normalized numbers as a nation. To change what 
            year you see you simply uncheck that year and click on the checkbox for another year. Same goes when you are on each individual state page. The only
            year that we could not find data for was 2012, we are not sure why we 
            could not find the data for that year and did not find many answers to why it was not 
            available to the public.</p>
